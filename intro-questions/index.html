        <li><strong>Jordan Shonfeld, Computer Science, Senior</strong></li>
        <li>I am a computer science major with an HCI minor. I am taking this class
            to improve my basic HTML and CSS skills and refine my web design skills </li>
        <li>I do have a bit of experience with HTML and CSS but mostly self taught, so this
            course will give me a stronger understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
            I hope to learn how to use responsive gridding with CSS.
        </li>
        <li>I do not have a lot of experience designing on paper, but I think the horizontal/vertical scroll makes the 
            design for a screen significantly different!
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">website with a good design</a>: I find this site to be sleek and 
        easy to digest. It is intended to be a design hub and still utilizes a simple UI, which I appreciate.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/">site with effective communication</a>: the wall street journal is a classic
        news source that I believe has effective communication. It presents so much information in a supremely digestivle way. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">a site that works well</a>: This site, LinkedIn, works extremely well.
        Not only does it run smoothly and efficiently, it accomplishes its goal of building a web of professionals through
    posts, followers, updates, and more.</li>
